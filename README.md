Hi! My name is Chris Callahan. I'm currently a postdoc in Earth System Science at Stanford University, working with [Noah Diffenbaugh](https://climatelab.stanford.edu/) and [Marshall Burke](https://www.stanfordecholab.com/). I did my PhD at Dartmouth College in the [EEES program](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/EEES/), working with Justin Mankin in the [Climate Modeling and Impacts Group](https://jsmankin.github.io).

My research focuses on the economic impacts of climate change. You can read more about me and my research on [my website](https://christophercallahan.me) and contact me at _christophercallahan (at) stanford (dot) edu_.
